# Jaxb-java-app
Base Java application that generates class files from an XSD schema using Jaxb.

There's nothing overall special about this app. It's a simple Maven project that uses Jaxb to generate Java classes using a sample XSD schema file.

To run this app, simply download the code, launch it in your IDE of choice and run from the main Application.class file. This will generate classes from the sample XSD, read in the XML to the necessary objects and output the results of the object contents in the console.

The sample Customer orders XSD and XML files were taken from Microsoft's test data website.
